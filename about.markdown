# Hi, I am Gerves Francois BANIAKINA
I started my academic curricula in undergraduate as a physicist and took a few computer science courses. Through the years, I became curious about how the computer was made and what was the difference between the hardware and the software. This led me to my Master's degree in computer science and artificial intelligence. I taught myself C#, HTML, CSS, React.js, Node.js, and web application programming.

I am passionate about programming, machine learning, artificial intelligence, mathematics and physics. I am a lifelong learner who loves to build software, which has led to look for a role of full-stack engineer, software engineer or machine learning engineer. I love solving puzzle. It's a great way to test my skills and strategy, stay sharp, and keep my mind active. I am also a quantum computing enthusiast and it has given me a broader perspective of computer science.

I am currently loooking for work that utilizes my expertise and academic background and allows me to grow as a full-stack engineer, software engineer, or machine learning engineer.
